Predicting Employee Turnover

An organization is only as good as its employees, and as such, this post is about predicting employee turnover.  The blog has been inspired by an article on the [Business Science](http://www.business-science.io/business/2017/09/18/hr_employee_attrition.html) website.  I thought using an automated machine learning algorithm to find the best model was pretty interesting, so I wanted to give it a try on some data I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics).
